# CerealBot
Cereal Bot for my discord server.
This bot uses the Discord API to make requests to Discord's Servers and interact with it.
An API - Application Programming Interface - is a type of software that lets external programs interact with your server and services.  
My discord bot can check if a user sends a specific command (using an event listener) and can output a message and do some processes.

- Added 'success' message for >suggest.
